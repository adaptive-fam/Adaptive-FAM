## Adaptive-FAM: *GPU-Accelerated Out-of-Core Volume Rendering with Functional Approximation and Adaptive Encoding for Interactive Exploration*

![results](https://github.com/adaptive-fam/Adaptive-FAM/blob/main/flame_blocks_small.png)

### Introduction
This repo contains the code of practicing the proposed Adaptive-FAM.

### Execution
Run Adaptive-FAM.ipynb for the proposed adaptive encoding using functional approximation. It includes steps of micro-blocks (without ghost area) creation and their modeling into micro-models.

Run block_partition_down_sampling.ipynb for micro-blocks without ghost area.
